# The Gold Mod
My first mod for Anuke's Mindustry. It adds new turrets, factories, items, zones and units to the game.
## Let's get started. 
### ![Gold Ingot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheSlaylord/GoldMod/update/sprites/items/goldIngot.png) Gold Ingot
A first tier and the main resource of the mod. You'll want to get much of it. You need a Laser/Airblast drill to mine the ore. Then you need to put the ores into the Gold Crucible to smelt your gold. Finally, you'd want to transport molten gold to the Gold Forge. Great, you've just got your first gold ingots! Use them to research and build defenses and to make ammunition for turrets!
### ![Shiny Alloy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheSlaylord/GoldMod/update/sprites/items/shinyAlloy.png) Shiny Alloy
A second tier material of the mod. They say the recipe of this alloy is held by a very strong machine in the spore lands. It is usually used to upgrade assembled shells, make strong units and build more turrets.
### ![Palladium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheSlaylord/GoldMod/update/sprites/items/palladium.png) Palladium
A third tier material which is found in few locations. It has unpredictable and strange properties. Only obtained after passing through terrifying machines guarding those places.
